# GitHub

- GitHub is a valuable tool all developers use to track changes to code and ahve access to version history of their files
- it also keeps their code safe from being lost due to a computer dying

- there are 4 things you should always get in the habit of when working with code:
1) Verify you have the latest code (git pull)
2) Refactor, test, and/or implement a small portion of cohesive code (test, code, test)
3) Commit and push (git commit, git push)
4) Repeat

# Startup ideas

- add ability to upload your own custom date ideas into a category so that other users can select them
- add functionality to track how many times a date has been committed to by other users so that users can see what's trending easily
- add functionality to message other users and ask them about their most recent date

# Markdown

- learned when doing the startup spec deliverable that you can't have white spaces in the names of your files because markdown will read it wrong when trying to import the file
- So, never have white spaces in file names
- Helpful link for learning markdown syntax: [GitHub markdown documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

# Git Bash/ Terminal

- use Git Bash to SSH into my web server
- DON'T restart/ update/ upgrade when in the middle of editting the web server files
- When changing directories, put "" around the path so the terminal reads it right
- don't put brackets around the key file name when ssh-ing into the web server
- don't have to change directory to the one where the key file is. if you don't do it, then just make sure to include the entire path to the key file from the directory you are currently in
- use the 'cat' command in terminal to view the contents of a document
- use 'vi' to modify the file, then press 'i' to edit the document
- to save and exit a file, press 'Esc' and then type ':wq'
- to turn off ubuntu/ end its connection with my server, type 'sudo poweroff'
