# GitHub

- GitHub is a valuable tool all developers use to track changes to code and ahve access to version history of their files
- it also keeps their code safe from being lost due to a computer dying

- there are 4 things you should always get in the habit of when working with code:
1) Verify you have the latest code (git pull)
2) Refactor, test, and/or implement a small portion of cohesive code (test, code, test)
3) Commit and push (git commit, git push)
4) Repeat
